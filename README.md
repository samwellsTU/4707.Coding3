## Understanding `let`, `const`, and Arrays

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of JavaScript variables using `let` and `const`, as well as your basic skills in manipulating arrays. You will complete a series of tasks that require you to declare variables, assign values, and perform operations on array data.

### Objectives

- Use `let` and `const` to declare variables
- Understand the scope and mutability of variables declared with `let` and `const`
- Perform basic array manipulations (adding, removing elements, iterating)

### Tasks

1. **Variables Practice**: Declare two variables using `let` and `const`.Assign any values of your choice.
   1. the `let` should be named `myLetVariable`
   2. the `const` should be named `myConstVariable`
2. **Array Creation**: Create an array named `myArray` and populate it with at least 3 different items. The data type of your items must be a `number`, `string`, `boolean` in that order.
3. **Array Manipulation**: 
   1. Add two new elements to `myArray` using the `.push()` method
      1. an `array`
      2. a `string`
   2. remove the first element unsing the `.shift()` method
   3. change the the second element (`index 1`) to the number `345`
